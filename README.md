## About the Project
Flibber was developed to address common challenges in research, including time-consuming data management, collaboration barriers, and version control issues. With a focus on building a collaborative research community, Flibber facilitates efficient teamwork, open communication, and continuous improvement among researchers across disciplines.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Get personalized feedback, recommendations, and strategies based on your research area.
- **Research Paper Summarization**: Generate concise summaries for research papers to extract essential information quickly.
- **Citation Management**: Streamline your references, making it easier to cite works accurately and efficiently.
- **Version Control**: Track changes in research projects with full version history.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Collaborate seamlessly with researchers across the globe.
- **Vultr Cloud Infrastructure**: Scalable data processing and storage powered by Vultr to handle high-performance computing needs.

## Project Architecture
Flibber is designed with a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility. Below is a high-level overview of its system architecture:

- **Frontend**: Built using Laravel Livewire with Ant Design (Antd) for a user-friendly interface.
